# 229project

**Abstract:** The field of post-disaster recovery modeling is currently limited by semi-heuristic assumptions. The ability to establish robust relationships is hindered by categorical, survey-based data. This project explores the use of regression methods, decision tree models, and neural networks to predict a household's post-disaster location of temporary shelter, a decision with significant implications on population out-migration. The resulting models perform substantially better than a random-guess trivial classifier but illustrate the challenges of class-imbalanced data.

**Data:** Public Use Microdata Sample from the 2017 American Housing Survey, performed by the U.S. Census Bureau <br />

CA_41860_31080.csv == data from San Francisco, Oakland, Hayward, Los Angeles, Long Beach, and Anaheim, CA <br />
